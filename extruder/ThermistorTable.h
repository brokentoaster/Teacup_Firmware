// Thermistor lookup table, generated with --num-temps=50 and trimmed in lower temperature ranges.
// You may be able to improve the accuracy of this table in various ways.
//   1. Measure the actual resistance of the resistor. It's "nominally" 4.7K, but that's Â± 5%.
//   2. Measure the actual beta of your thermistor:http://reprap.org/wiki/MeasuringThermistorBeta
//   3. Generate more table entries than you need, then trim down the ones in uninteresting ranges. (done)
// In either case you'll have to regenerate this table, which requires python, which is difficult to install on windows.
// Since you'll have to do some testing to determine the correct temperature for your application anyway, you
// may decide that the effort isn't worth it. Who cares if it's reporting the "right" temperature as long as it's
// keeping the temperature steady enough to print, right?
